# Hello-World
My introduction to the GitHub world
I live in SoCal but grew up in New Mexico...they do have running water there because it is actually a state (believe me, many have asked that question throughout my life).
Running water is a major plus in modern society.

I think doing this over and over helps you to understand what to do.  
If I had it all to do over again, I would not be so proud as a young one and listen to advice from elders.
